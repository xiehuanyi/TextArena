# SimpleBlindAuction Environment Documentation

## Overview
**SimpleBlindAuction** is a streamlined 2-player auction game where players bid on items with different personal valuations. The game consists of two phases: a conversation phase where players freely communicate, followed by a bidding phase where each player submits blind bids for items. Players aim to maximize profit by strategically bidding on items worth more to them than what they pay. This simplified version removes the complexity of private messaging while maintaining the core auction mechanics.

## Action Space

- **Format:** Actions are strings that vary based on the current game phase:
  - **Conversation Phase:**
    - Simply type normal messages (no special formatting required)
    - All messages are automatically public
  - **Bidding Phase:**
    - **Bid:** `[Bid on Item X: amount]` where X is an item ID and amount is the bid in coins

- **Examples:**
  - During conversation: `I'm interested in the Ancient Vase. Which items are you looking at?`
  - During bidding: `[Bid on Item 0: 250] [Bid on Item 3: 175]`

- **Notes:** Players can include multiple bids in a single bidding action, allowing them to bid on multiple items simultaneously.

## Observation Space

**Reset Observations**
On reset, each player receives a prompt containing their starting capital, item information, and personal valuations. For example:

```plaintext
You are Player 0 in a 2-player Simple Blind Auction game.

You have 1000 coins to bid on 5 valuable items.

The auction has two phases:
1. Conversation Phase (3 rounds): Talk with the other player. All messages are public.
2. Bidding Phase (1 round): Submit blind bids on items. Highest bidder wins each item.

Available Items (with their value TO YOU):
- Item 0: Ancient Vase - Value to you: 420 coins
- Item 1: Diamond Necklace - Value to you: 385 coins
- Item 2: Antique Clock - Value to you: 175 coins
- Item 3: Signed Painting - Value to you: 290 coins
- Item 4: Gold Statue - Value to you: 510 coins

Note: Each player may value items differently, up to ¬±20% difference!

How to play:
- Conversation Phase: Just type your messages normally
- Bidding Phase: Use '[Bid on Item X: amount]' format to bid
  Example: '[Bid on Item 0: 250] [Bid on Item 3: 175]'

Your goal is to win items that are worth more to you than what you paid.
The player with the highest net worth at the end wins.
Net worth = remaining capital + value of won items.
```

**Step Observations**
During gameplay, players receive observations based on actions taken. For example:

```plaintext
[Player 1] I'm interested in the Antique Clock and Silver Chalice. What about you?
[Player 0] I'm more interested in the Gold Statue, but might bid on the Ancient Vase too.

[GAME] Conversation phase complete! Now entering the bidding phase.
Please submit your bids using the format: [Bid on Item X: amount]
You can submit multiple bids in one turn, for example:
[Bid on Item 0: 150] [Bid on Item 2: 200] [Bid on Item 4: 350]

[GAME] You submitted bids for Items: 0, 4.
[GAME] Player 1 has submitted bids.
