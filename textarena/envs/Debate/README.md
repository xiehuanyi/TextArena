# Debate Environment

## Overview
**Debate** is a two-player game where each player is assigned a side on a given topicâ€”either Affirmative or Negative. Players present arguments in turns to convince a panel of simulated judges. The winner is determined by the change in judges' opinions before and after the debate.

## Action Space
- **Format:** Actions are strings representing the player's arguments.
- **Example:** 
    - `"I believe that technology improves our lives because..."`
    - `"My opponent overlooks the fact that..."`

## Observation Space

### Observations
Each player receives messages exchanged during the debate, including their assigned topic and position.

**Initial Observation:**
```plaintext
You are Player {player_id} in the Debate game.
Topic: {topic}
Your position: {'Affirmative'|'Negative'}
You will have {max_turns} turns to present your arguments.
On your turn, simply type your argument.
```

**Turn Observation:**
After each step, players receive the latest argument. For example:
```plaintext
[Player 0]: While the idea of free education for all citizens sounds appealing, it is important to consider the economic implications and potential drawbacks. Implementing a system of free education would require substantial funding, which would likely result in increased taxes or budget cuts in other critical areas such as healthcare, infrastructure, or social services. This could place a strain on the economy and potentially lead to negative consequences for citizens in other aspects of their lives. Additionally, without the financial investment from students and their families, educational institutions may face challenges in maintaining the quality of education, as they may struggle to attract and retain qualified teachers, update their facilities, and provide necessary resources. Therefore, it is crucial to weigh the economic costs and potential impacts on educational quality before embracing free education for all.
```

## Gameplay
