## Example Usage

```python
import textarena as ta

## initalize agents
agents = {
    0: ta.agents.OpenRouterAgent(model_name="gpt-4o"),
    1: ta.agents.OpenRouterAgent(model_name="anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet"),
}

## initialize the environment
env = ta.make("Poker-v0")

## Wrap the environment for easier observation handling
env = ta.wrappers.LLMObservationWrapper(env=env)

## Wrap the environment for pretty rendering
env = ta.wrappers.SimpleRenderWrapper(
    env=env,
    player_names={0: "GPT-4o", 1: "Claude-3.5-Sonnet"}
)

## reset the environment to start a new game
env.reset(seed=490)

## Game loop
done = False
while not done:

    # Get player id and observation
    player_id, observation = env.get_observation()

    # Agent decides on an action based on the observation
    action = agents[player_id](observation)

    # Execute the action in the environment
    done, info = env.step(action=action)

rewards = env.close()
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Invalid Bet Amount:**
    - **Issue:** Player attempts to bet or raise more chips than they have.
    - **Solution:** Ensure bet amount is less than or equal to player's remaining chips.

- **Invalid Action Sequence:**
    - **Issue:** Player tries to check when there's a bet to call.
    - **Solution:** Player must either call, raise, or fold when facing a bet.

- **Missing Action Token:**
    - **Issue:** Action string doesn't contain a valid action token.
    - **Solution:** Include one of `[Check]`, `[Call]`, `[Fold]`, `[Bet <amount>]`, or `[Raise <amount>]`.
