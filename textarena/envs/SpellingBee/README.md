# Spelling Bee Environment Documentation

## Overview
**Spelling Bee** is a two-player word game where players take turns creating valid English words using only a limited set of allowed letters. The challenge increases as the game progresses because each new word must be at least as long as the previous word. Players must balance vocabulary knowledge with strategic thinking to outmaneuver their opponent by forcing them into increasingly difficult positions. This implementation features frequency-weighted letter selection to ensure balanced and playable letter sets.

## Action Space

- **Format:** Actions are strings representing a valid English word wrapped in square brackets.
- **Examples:**
  - Submit the word "example": `[example]`
  - Submit the word "fantastic": `[fantastic]`
- **Notes:** Words must only contain letters from the allowed set, must be at least as long as the previous word, and cannot be words that have already been used in the game.

## Observation Space

**Reset Observations**
On reset, each player receives a prompt containing the allowed letters for the game. For example:

```plaintext
You are Player 0 in the Spelling Bee Game.
Allowed Letters: aeinrst
Each word must be at least as long as the previous word.
Repeated words are not allowed.
Wrap your word in square brackets, e.g., '[example]'.
```

**Step Observations**
During gameplay, players can observe all words submitted so far. For example:

```plaintext
[Player 0] I'll start with a short word: [tar]
[Player 1] Building on that length: [nest]
[Player 0] I'll use more letters now: [strain]
[Player 1] This is getting challenging. Let me try: [transit]
```
