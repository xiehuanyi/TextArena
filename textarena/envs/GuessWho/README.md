# Guess Who Environment Documentation

## Overview

The Guess Who Environment is a single-player adaptation of the two-player version we are familiar with. It is question-driven where a player aims to deduce the target character selected by the gamemaster. The gamemaster, configurable in behavior, responds to each question with "Yes", "No" or "I don't know" based on the target character, guiding the player toward a correct guess. The environment tracks player moves, validates guesses (formatted as [name]), and updates the game state for each interaction, offering a structured and engaging experience that challenges players' deductive reasoning and strategic questioning skills. 

## Action Space
- **Format:** Actions are strings that can either be a question or a final guess that is formatted as [name]. For example:
- **Example:**
    - To ask a question: "Does the character have a blue eyes?"
    - To make a final guess: [Tom]
- **Notes:** Players can ask any yes-or-no question, and the gamemaster will respond with "Yes", "No" or "I don't know". To submit a final guess, the player must enclose their guess in square brackets (e.g. [Tom]). Incorrectly formatted guesses will be marked as a normal question. 

## Observation Space
**Reset Observation:**
On reset, the observation provides the initial prompt. For example:
```plaintext
[GAME] You are Player 0. You are playing Guess Who.
The gamemaster has chosen one target character from the list of characters that you will be shown below.
You have to guess the target character by asking yes-or-no questions about the target character's traits.
You can ask questions like 'Is the character male?' or 'Does the character have a beard?'.
You can also guess the name of the target character at any time by ensuring that you wrap their name in square brackets, e.g. [Zach].

**Step Observation:**
After each step, the environment returns the action (e.g. "Yes", "No", "I don't know"). For example:
```plaintext
[Player 0] Is the character male?
[GAME] Yes
```

By default, the environment returns observations in the following format:
```python
{
  player_id: int : [
    (sender_id: int, message: str),
    (sender_id: int, message: str),
    ...
  ]
}
```

**Note:** _Should the judge be unable to interpret the questions and provide one of the three assigned options - "yes", "no" or "I don't know" - the judge will respond with "I'm sorry, I don't understand. Please try asking again." in an effort to get the player to rephrase its action._

## Gameplay
**Game Setup:** The game begins with the `reset` method selecting a target character from a predefined character list. The player then initiates the game by asking yes-or-no questions to uncover hints about the target character.

**Turns:** Players take turns by either asking questions or making a final guess. Each turn, the player can ask questions like, “Does the character have blue eyes?” The gamemaster will respond with "Yes," "No," or "I don’t know," providing clues for deducing the character. To submit a final guess of the character, players must wrap it in square brackets (e.g., [Tom]). The environment tracks questions asked, and the correctness of the final guess.

**Objective:** The player’s goal is to identify the target character using the information gleaned from the gamemaster's responses. By formulating strategic questions, the player can narrow down the possibilities and improve their chances of guessing correctly.

**Winning Condition:** The game is won if the player successfully guesses the target character within the allowable turns of the game - 40 turns by default. If the player’s guess matches the target character, they receive a congratulatory message, confirming the win. If incorrect, the player loses the game.


## Key Rules:

- **Valid Moves:**
    - For the submission of final guesses, the player must follow the structure of [Tom].
    - The player is allowed to think through its questions, as well as also ask questions that are a combination of features.

- **Invalid Moves:**
    - A move is invalid if the player makes the wrong guess of the target character.
